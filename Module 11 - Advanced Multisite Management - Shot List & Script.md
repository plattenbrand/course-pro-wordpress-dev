# Module 11: Advanced Multisite Management - Shot List & Script

## Shot 1: Introduction to Multisite (Wide Shot at Desk)

**TEXT:** "Welcome to this special module on WordPress Multisite management. WordPress Multisite is a powerful feature that allows you to run multiple websites from a single WordPress installation. It's particularly valuable for agencies managing multiple client sites, educational institutions with various department sites, or businesses with multiple brand websites. In this module, we'll explore advanced multisite management techniques that integrate with our professional WordPress development workflow."

## Shot 2: Multisite Architecture Overview (Screen with Diagram)

**TEXT:** "Let's start with understanding WordPress multisite architecture. Multisite uses a single WordPress codebase but creates separate database tables for each site. It can be configured in either a subdomain structure like site1.example.com or a subdirectory structure like example.com/site1. In our Bedrock-based setup, multisite configuration is controlled through environment variables, making it easy to enable or disable across different environments. Let's examine how this works under the hood."

## Shot 3: Enabling Multisite in Bedrock (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "Now let's see how to enable multisite in our Bedrock installation. Unlike traditional WordPress, where you modify wp-config.php directly, Bedrock uses environment variables in the .env file. We'll set WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE to true, configure the multisite type with MULTISITE, and set up the necessary domain settings. This environment-based approach gives us tremendous flexibility, allowing different configurations across development, staging, and production environments."

## Shot 4: Local Development for Multisite (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Setting up local development for multisite requires special consideration. We need to configure our local domains properly, especially for subdomain installations. With Laravel Valet, we'll set up wildcard domains to handle any subdomain, and configure our hosts file accordingly. For database configuration, we'll use appropriate prefixes and ensure our local environment mirrors production. I'll also show you WP-CLI commands specifically for multisite network initialization."

## Shot 5: Network Administration (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Let's explore the network administration dashboard, which is the control center for your multisite installation. Here you can manage all sites, create new ones, install network-wide plugins and themes, and configure network settings. Understanding the difference between network-wide activation and individual site activation is crucial for proper multisite management. Let's walk through the key sections and administrative tasks."

## Shot 6: Site-Specific Configuration in Multisite (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "One challenge in multisite environments is maintaining site-specific configurations while sharing core code. Let's examine techniques for handling site-specific settings, including environment variables for individual sites, dynamic configuration loading based on the current site, and proper organization of site-specific theme customizations. These approaches allow you to maintain a single codebase while accommodating the unique needs of each site in your network."

## Shot 7: Domain Mapping Configuration (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Many multisite networks need to support custom domains for different sites. Let's set up domain mapping, allowing each site to have its own unique domain while still being part of the multisite network. We'll configure the necessary environment variables, set up the proper server configurations, and test the domain mapping functionality. This capability is essential for professional multisite deployments where sites need their own brand identity."

## Shot 8: Database Considerations for Multisite (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Multisite has unique database considerations. Each site gets its own set of tables with a numeric prefix, while network-wide tables are shared. When synchronizing databases between environments, we need to handle these relationships properly. Let's examine our sync script's multisite-specific features that ensure proper handling of network tables, domain mappings, and cross-site relationships during synchronization."

## Shot 9: Multisite Content Synchronization (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Synchronizing content between sites in a multisite network can be challenging. Let's explore strategies for content sharing, including the use of plugins for content syndication, custom development approaches for sharing specific content types, and techniques for maintaining content relationships across sites. These approaches are valuable for networks where some content needs to appear on multiple sites."

## Shot 10: Shared vs. Site-Specific Plugins and Themes (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "In a multisite network, you need to decide which plugins and themes should be shared across all sites and which should be site-specific. Let's examine strategies for managing this distinction, including network-wide activation, per-site activation, and considering the performance implications of each approach. I'll also show you how our Composer-based workflow handles multisite plugin management."

## Shot 11: Multisite User Management (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "User management in multisite networks offers additional complexity and capabilities. We can have network administrators, site administrators, and users with roles on specific sites. Let's explore strategies for user organization, including shared logins across sites, site-specific user management, and handling user roles and capabilities in a multisite context. These approaches help maintain proper access control across your network."

## Shot 12: Multisite Testing Strategies (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Testing in a multisite environment requires special attention. We need to test both individual site functionality and network-wide features. Let's explore multisite testing strategies, including setting up test sites within your network, automated testing approaches for multisite, and ensuring that changes to shared resources don't negatively impact individual sites. These testing practices help maintain quality across your entire network."

## Shot 13: Multisite Deployment Considerations (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Deploying multisite networks requires careful planning. We need to handle database migrations properly, ensure domain configurations are correct for each environment, and manage shared resources effectively. Let's explore multisite-specific deployment strategies using our deployer configuration, including handling domain mappings across environments and ensuring smooth transitions during updates."

## Shot 14: Performance Optimization for Multisite (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Multisite networks can face unique performance challenges, especially as the number of sites grows. Let's explore performance optimization strategies specifically for multisite, including proper caching setups, database optimization for shared tables, and minimizing the impact of network-wide plugins. These approaches help maintain good performance even as your network expands."

## Shot 15: Scaling Multisite Networks (Talking Head with Slides)

**TEXT:** "As your multisite network grows, you may need to scale your infrastructure. Let's discuss approaches for scaling WordPress multisite, including horizontal scaling with multiple web servers, database scaling strategies, and considerations for large media libraries across multiple sites. These scaling strategies ensure your multisite network can handle growth while maintaining performance."

## Shot 16: Multisite Security Considerations (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Multisite networks face additional security considerations beyond single-site installations. We need to manage security boundaries between sites, handle network-wide vulnerabilities, and implement proper isolation. Let's explore multisite security best practices, including controlling plugin access, implementing network-wide security measures, and monitoring across your entire network."

## Shot 17: Conclusion and Best Practices (Wide Shot at Desk)

**TEXT:** "Let's wrap up with multisite management best practices. These include starting with a clear network structure plan, implementing proper documentation for site-specific configurations, establishing content sharing policies, creating consistent branding guidelines for network sites, and developing site provisioning workflows. Following these practices will help you maintain a professional, manageable WordPress multisite network that scales with your needs."
