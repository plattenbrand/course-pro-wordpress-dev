# Module 2: Setting Up SatisPress - Shot List & Script

## Shot 1: Introduction to SatisPress (Wide Shot at Desk)

**TEXT:** "Welcome to Module 2 of our Professional WordPress Development course. In this module, we're going to set up SatisPress, which is a crucial tool that solves one of the biggest challenges in professional WordPress
  development: how to manage premium plugins using Composer. By the end of this module, you'll have a private Composer repository that allows you to install and update premium plugins just like any other dependency."

## Shot 2: The Premium Plugin Problem (Screen with Graphics)

**TEXT:** "First, let's understand the problem. In professional WordPress development, we want to manage all our dependencies with Composer. This works great for free plugins through WPackagist, but premium plugins present a
  challenge. They're typically installed manually through the WordPress dashboard or via direct download, making them difficult to version control and automate. This disrupts our professional workflow and can lead to inconsistencies
   across environments."

## Shot 3: What is SatisPress (Screen Recording with Diagrams)

**TEXT:** "SatisPress, created by Cedaro, solves this problem by acting as a private Composer repository for your premium WordPress plugins. It transforms a WordPress installation into a Composer repository, storing your premium
  plugins securely while making them available to your Composer-based projects. Essentially, it bridges the gap between WordPress's plugin system and modern PHP dependency management."

## Shot 4: SatisPress Architecture (Animated Diagram)

**TEXT:** "Here's how SatisPress works in our professional workflow. We set up a separate WordPress installation dedicated to running SatisPress. We install and activate our premium plugins there, and SatisPress creates
  Composer-compatible packages from them. Our main WordPress projects can then pull these packages using Composer, just like any other dependency. This keeps our workflow consistent and our codebase clean."

## Shot 5: Setting Up a WordPress Site for SatisPress (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Let's start by setting up a dedicated WordPress site for SatisPress. I recommend using a subdomain like assets.yourdomain.com. This should be a clean WordPress installation - it doesn't need a fancy theme or other plugins
  since its only purpose is to serve as a repository. I'm going to walk through this installation process step by step, from setting up the database to configuring the site."

## Shot 6: Installing and Configuring SatisPress (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Now that we have our WordPress site set up, let's install the SatisPress plugin. You can download it from the WordPress plugin repository or directly from GitHub. After activating the plugin, we need to configure it
  properly. This includes setting up the repository location, configuring authentication, and ensuring proper security. These settings are crucial for creating a reliable Composer repository."

## Shot 7: Security Considerations (Talking Head with Bullet Points)

**TEXT:** "Before we continue, let's talk about security. Your SatisPress repository will contain premium plugins that often have licensing restrictions. It's essential to secure this repository properly. This includes implementing
  proper authentication, restricting access to authorized users only, setting up HTTPS, and configuring server-level security. We don't want to expose our premium plugins to unauthorized users."

## Shot 8: Adding Premium Plugins to SatisPress (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Now let's add some premium plugins to our SatisPress repository. I'll demonstrate with popular premium plugins like ACF Pro, Elementor Pro, and WP All Import Pro. The process involves uploading the plugin to WordPress,
  activating it, and then adding it to SatisPress. Once added, SatisPress creates the necessary Composer package information, making the plugin available for use in your projects."

## Shot 9: Managing Plugin Versions (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "An important aspect of using SatisPress is managing plugin versions. When a plugin receives an update, you'll need to update it in your SatisPress repository as well. Let me show you how this process works, from updating the
  plugin in WordPress to ensuring the new version is properly packaged and available in your Composer repository. This ensures your projects always have access to the latest versions."

## Shot 10: Connecting to SatisPress via Composer (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "Now that our SatisPress repository is set up and populated with plugins, let's connect it to our main WordPress project. This involves adding the repository to our `composer.json` file and configuring authentication. Here's
  an example of what this configuration looks like. We'll add our SatisPress repository URL, set up authentication tokens, and then require our premium plugins just like any other Composer package."

## Shot 11: Authentication Token Management (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Authentication is a crucial part of using private Composer repositories. Let me show you how to create and manage authentication tokens in SatisPress, and how to securely store these tokens in your development environment
  using `auth.json`. This ensures that your Composer can authenticate with your private repository while keeping your credentials secure and out of version control."

## Shot 12: Testing the Setup (Screen Recording)

**TEXT:** "Let's validate our setup by installing a premium plugin through Composer. We'll run `composer require` for one of our premium plugins and watch as Composer connects to our SatisPress repository, authenticates, and downloads
  the package. This confirms that our entire workflow is functioning as expected and that we can now manage premium plugins through Composer just like any other dependency."

## Shot 13: Troubleshooting Common Issues (Talking Head with Slides)

**TEXT:** "Before we wrap up this module, let's address some common issues you might encounter when setting up SatisPress. These include authentication problems, version constraints, plugin compatibility issues, and server
  configuration challenges. Understanding these potential pitfalls and how to resolve them will save you time and frustration as you implement this solution."

## Shot 14: Conclusion and Next Steps (Wide Shot at Desk)

**TEXT:** "Congratulations! You've now set up SatisPress and integrated it with your WordPress development workflow. This is a significant step toward professional WordPress development, allowing you to manage all your dependencies,
  including premium plugins, through Composer. In the next module, we'll set up our local development environment, building on what we've learned so far. See you there!"
