# Module 7: Database and File Synchronization - Shot List & Script

## Shot 1: Introduction to Synchronization Challenges (Wide Shot at Desk)

**TEXT:** "Welcome to Module 7 of our Professional WordPress Development course. In this module, we'll tackle one of the most challenging aspects of WordPress development: database and file synchronization between environments. Unlike
   code that can be version-controlled with Git, WordPress stores critical data in the database and uploads directory, which need special handling. By the end of this module, you'll have a reliable system for keeping your
  environments in sync, ensuring consistent testing and smooth deployments."

## Shot 2: The WordPress Sync Problem (Screen with Diagram)

**TEXT:** "Let's first understand why synchronization is challenging in WordPress. WordPress stores content, settings, and configuration in the database, while user uploads go to the uploads directory. Neither of these can be
  effectively version controlled with Git. Additionally, WordPress hardcodes URLs in the database, making simple database copies between environments problematic. When we move from one environment to another, we need to address
  these issues systematically."

## Shot 3: Synchronization Strategies Overview (Talking Head with Slides)

**TEXT:** "There are several approaches to WordPress synchronization, each with trade-offs. You can use manual exports and imports, dedicated WordPress migration plugins, or custom scripts. For professional workflows, custom scripts
  often provide the best balance of control and automation. Our approach uses a bash script that combines WP-CLI, SSH, and rsync to handle both database and file synchronization, with proper URL replacements and environment-specific
   considerations."

## Shot 4: Understanding the Sync Script (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "Let's examine our sync.sh script in detail. This script automates the process of syncing databases and files between environments. It includes configuration for development, staging, and production environments, handles SSH
   connections, manages database exports and imports, performs search-replace operations for URLs, and synchronizes files. I'll walk through the main components of the script, explaining how each part works and why it's structured
  this way."

## Shot 5: Script Configuration Section (Close-up of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "The first part of our sync script is the configuration section. Here we define our environment URLs, server paths, SSH settings, and site configurations. For multisite installations, we need to define all subsite URLs for
  each environment. This configuration is critical since it determines where data is pulled from and pushed to, as well as how URL replacements are handled. Let's go through each setting and what it controls."

## Shot 6: Database Synchronization Logic (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "The core of our sync script is the database synchronization functionality. This section handles exporting the database from the source environment, importing it to the target environment, and performing search-replace
  operations to update URLs and paths. The script includes handling for both local and remote environments, proper error checking, and compatibility fixes for different MySQL versions. Let's explore how this works in detail."

## Shot 7: File Synchronization Logic (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "Next, let's look at the file synchronization part of the script. This uses rsync to efficiently transfer files between environments, specifically focusing on the uploads directory. The script includes configuration for
  excluding certain directories, handling permissions, and managing connections between different server types. This ensures that user uploads and media are consistent across environments without transferring unnecessary files."

## Shot 8: Search-Replace Operations (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "One of the most critical aspects of WordPress synchronization is performing proper search-replace operations to update URLs and paths in the database. Our script includes a comprehensive function for this, handling all
  sites in a multisite installation and properly escaping values. Let's examine how this function works and why it's essential for successful synchronization."

## Shot 9: Safety Features and Confirmation (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "Professional synchronization tools need safety features to prevent accidental data loss. Our script includes confirmation prompts, environment validation, and special protections for production environments. These features
  help prevent mistakes that could overwrite important data or disrupt live sites. Let's look at these safeguards and how they protect your WordPress installations."

## Shot 10: Selective Sync Options (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "Sometimes you only need to sync databases or files, not both. Our script includes options for selective synchronization, allowing you to specify whether to sync just the database, just the files, or both. This flexibility
  is important for different workflow scenarios. Let's examine how these options work and when you might use each one."

## Shot 11: Multisite Considerations (Screen Recording of Code Editor)

**TEXT:** "WordPress multisite installations require special handling during synchronization. Our script includes specific configurations for multisite, handling network tables, domain mappings, and subdomain/subdirectory structures.
  Let's look at these multisite-specific features and how they ensure proper synchronization across all sites in the network."

## Shot 12: Running the Sync Script (Screen Recording with Terminal)

**TEXT:** "Now let's see the sync script in action. I'll demonstrate syncing from production to development, showing each step of the process from initial confirmation to database export, import, search-replace operations, and file
  synchronization. You'll see how the script handles each phase and the output it provides to confirm successful operation."

## Shot 13: Syncing Development to Staging (Screen Recording with Terminal)

**TEXT:** "Let's also demonstrate syncing from development to staging, which is a common workflow when preparing to deploy new features. This direction is different because we're pushing changes up rather than pulling them down. I'll
  show how the script handles this scenario, including the safeguards that prevent accidental overwriting of staging data."

## Shot 14: Handling Synchronization Errors (Screen Recording with Terminal)

**TEXT:** "Even with a well-designed script, synchronization can sometimes encounter issues. Let's look at common error scenarios and how to troubleshoot them. I'll demonstrate a few typical problems—like connection failures,
  permission issues, or database constraints—and show how to diagnose and resolve these issues to get your synchronization back on track."

## Shot 15: Using Sync for Database Backups (Screen Recording with Terminal)

**TEXT:** "Our sync script can also be used for creating database backups. Let's look at how to use the script's backup functionality to create snapshots of your database before making major changes. This is an important safety
  measure for professional WordPress development and provides an additional layer of protection against data loss."

## Shot 16: Alternative Synchronization Tools (Talking Head with Slides)

**TEXT:** "While our custom script works well for many scenarios, there are other synchronization tools worth knowing about. Let's briefly explore alternatives like WP Migrate DB Pro, WP-CLI's built-in commands, and server-level
  solutions like database replication. Each has its advantages in specific situations, and understanding the options helps you choose the right tool for different projects."

## Shot 17: Synchronization Best Practices (Talking Head with Bullet Points)

**TEXT:** "Let's wrap up with some best practices for WordPress synchronization. These include creating regular backups, documenting environment differences, careful handling of sensitive data, selective sync strategies, and
  integration with your deployment workflow. Following these practices will help ensure smooth, reliable synchronization as part of your professional WordPress development process."

## Shot 18: Conclusion and Next Steps (Wide Shot at Desk)

**TEXT:** "Congratulations! You now have a robust system for database and file synchronization between WordPress environments. This solves one of the most challenging aspects of professional WordPress development and completes our
  workflow from local development to staging and production. In the next module, we'll explore deployment strategies, focusing on how to reliably and safely deploy WordPress sites to production. See you there!"
